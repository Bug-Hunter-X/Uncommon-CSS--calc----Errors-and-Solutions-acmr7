The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, sometimes it is misused leading to unexpected results. For example, when using percentages within `calc()`, the percentage is relative to the containing element's property, not necessarily the element the calculation is applied to.  Another issue occurs when there are missing spaces or incorrect operator precedence.  Incorrect units can also lead to calculation errors. For instance, trying to add `px` and `em` directly.
